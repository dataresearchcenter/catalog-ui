# About this catalog

This is a collaborative collection of datasets that are common to use for *follow the money* investigations.

The datasets can be easily imported into [OpenAleph](https://openaleph.org) or other tools within the [followthemoney](https://followthemoney.tech) ecosystem.

This data catalog includes datasets maintained by the [Data and Research Center](https://dataresearchcenter.org), [OpenSanctions](https://opensanctions.org), and others.

## Use the data

You can [browse some of the datasets online](https://search.openaleph.org/datasets) or download bulk data for [non-commercial use](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#using-licensed-material) as defined by Creative Commons.

We can help to integrate this data into your research infrastructure, e.g. *OpenAleph*, or enrich and crossmatch data with other sources. [Just get in touch](https://dataresearchcenter.org/contact) and we can see how we can help.

### Commercial use

Commercial use of this data is not implemented yet. If you are interested in commercial use of the data, contact us at [hi@dataresearchcenter.org](mailto:hi@dataresearchcenter.org).

For the **OpenSanctions** datasets, [please refer directly to their website](https://www.opensanctions.org/licensing/) for how to obtain data for commercial use.


## Get involved

This is a collaborative project. You can submit new datasets or data errors easily on various ways.

There are various ways to get involved:

### Discourse

Join the [DARC community discourse](https://darc.li) and be part of the discussion.

### Github

The development and issue tracking happens in [this repository](https://github.com/dataresearchcenter/investigraph-eu).

#### Submit a data issue

If you spotted an error or quality issue within a dataset, we prefer a [github issue](https://github.com/dataresearchcenter/investigraph-eu/issues). If you don't have a github account, join the slack (see above) and discuss the issue there. If you don't want to join slack, just write to [hi@investigativedata.org](mailto:hi@investigativedata.org)

### Submit a new dataset

#### As a data user

Add your dataset with a brief description to the [dataset wishlist (Google Spreadsheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10oZOKG-zk3UOFJXvUxh0OsuIvWVlSVMbZTlDO_lAAgY/edit?usp=sharing)

#### As a coder

We are happy to add more datasources to the catalog. Here are a few lines about the involved technology.

This project is build upon [investigraph](https://investigraph.dev), an etl framework for [Follow The Money](https://followthemoney.tech) data written in python.

Head over to the [investigraph documentation](https://docs.investigraph.dev) to learn how the framework works.

Depending on the source data, adding a new dataset might involve some python coding knowledge.

Check out the [datasets folder](https://github.com/dataresearchcenter/investigraph-eu/tree/main/datasets) in our repo to get examples for the existing datasets.
